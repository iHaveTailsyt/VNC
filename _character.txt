Charactor story :
    In the small, unknown village, a girl is being watched by everyone from the village. "Demon," "Devil," it's a name that the villagers gave and call to her because of her heterochromia.
She always gets bullied and has at least a new scar after she gets home. "Mom... Dad..." Her broken voice still calls for her parents, but both her mom and dad are already dead since she was young.
She's interested in magic and starts to learn about it not long after she loses her parents. Many years pass... She masters most of the advanced magic.
She mostly gets tired after practicing her magic. At that time, she still gets bullied by the villagers by interrupting her while she's practicing her magic.
One day, when she gets into the forest to collect food for her dinner, she feels sleepy while traveling back to her home, so she takes a rest at the tree.
Suddenly, after she sits on the root, she gets into a trap that a hunter made to trap a bear. She's now hanging on the tree with ropes wrapped around her body.
She can't use magic or even move. She screams, "ANYONE HELP ME!" but no one comes.
After a while, a big monster with a big axe comes after her scream. She tries to move her body to get out of the ropes, but it doesn't work.
The monster is coming closer to her. She thought this is her last moment of her life. She accepts her death and slowly closes her eyes while the monster is coming closer to her.

    . . .   Suddenly, a monster screams in pain and collapses on the ground. "Rest in peace, Mr. Monster," a huge sword swings and cuts the monster's head in front of her eyes. She is shocked for a moment.

"I don't have a name," she responds. Lonie responds back, "Today's star is so beautiful, so I'm going to call you 'Lunar.'" At that moment, Lunar sees Lonie's bright hair reflect from the moon like a lamp that leads her out of darkness.
Lunar responds quietly, "Yes..." Lonie asks, "Where is your home?" Lunar turns her face away and says, "I don't want to go back anymore." "Why? Your family is worried about you?" Lonie says.
Lunar tells her about what she got from her village and about her family. "I'm sorry about that," Lonie says. Lunar nods. "What about coming and staying with me at my home?" Lonie says.
Lunar is surprised about Lonie's invite for a while. She responds, "Yes, take me with you." And then she always follows Lonie ever since. No matter how dangerous the place Lonie goes, she will go anywhere with her.
