Prologue

    England 2079
[Girl]: "I-Is this ok...?"
[Boss]: "Is this all you can do in one week? USELESS. Don't come back if there's no progress at all!"
[Girl]: "! ... Yes..."

An office worker girl had been working hard for a month straight, but her boss complains again.
She tries her best on her work, but other co-workers like to put their work on her, and only her, for some reason, which makes her work not progress at all.
All the co-workers already know this, but they don't care.

[Girl]: " ... "
[Co-worker 1]: "Can you help me with this work?"
[Girl]: "I-I still hav- "
[Co-worker 1]: "Thank you."
[Girl]: " ... again..."

She sometimes thinks about quitting her job and finding a better one, but no one wants to hire her to work because they already have a lot of employees at their office.

[Girl]: " ... Maybe... just maybe... What if I die and was reborn in another world like in isekai novel. Just saying, haha..."

She likes to read isekai novels during her free time. She often thinks about killing herself and living a happier life in the afterlife.

[Girl]: "It's 8 PM already? Maybe I should go home and make something to eat for dinne- "
[Girl]: " ... Why is everything black... I can't see anything... What happened to me."


Chapter I-I : Lonie

[Girl]: "It's been so long... So long, a long time..."
[Girl]: "I can't even remember how long I've been here."
[Girl]: "I didn't even know where or what "here" was."
[Girl]: "I don't even know what happened before I got to this pitch black and empty place like this."

"In a dark, empty place like this, a normal human would surely go crazy," the girl thought to herself.

[Girl]: "What is that light?"
[Girl]: "It's so... warm...."
[Girl]: "Is this heaven? Am I finally free from this place...?"

[Unknown Female Voice 1]: "It's a girl."
[Unknown Female Voice 2]: "Can I see her face?"
[Unknown Female Voice 1]: "Here."
[Unknown Female Voice 2]: "She's so cute."
[Unknown Male Voice 1]: "Of course she's our daughter."

[Girl/Lonie]: "(What's happening? Where am I? Who are you?)"
[Girl/Lonie]: "(It looks like I still have my past memories)"
[Girl/Lonie]: "(I'll pretend to know nothing for now)"
[Girl/Lonie]: "(I was just reborn, after all)"

15 years passed, and the girl, now named Lonie, had grown a lot. She had become a warrior, just like her dad. After she received her class, her dad taught her how to fight and gave her a sword. She joined a guild at the age of 13 and began her adventures.

[Lunar]: "Hey Lonie, are you okay?"
[Lonie]: "Huh?"

Lunar was Lonie's close friend, having been saved by Lonie from a monster attack and choosing to follow her ever since.

[Lunar]: "You spaced out for a while. What were you thinking about?"
[Lonie]: "Just random things."
[Lunar]: "I see..."
[Lunar]: "By the way, we're close to Litlamp town."

Litlamp town was the main town of the country and Lonie's hometown.

[Lonie]: "I can't wait to see my parents again."
[Lunar]: "Can I ask you something?"
[Lonie]: "Yes?"
[Lunar]: "How long have you been away from home?"
[Lonie]: "Please don't call it running away."
[Lonie]: "Hmm... About two years or so."
[Lunar]: "So you've been away from home for two years now?"
[Lonie]: "Stop it."
[Lunar]: "Okay, I'll stop."
[Lunar]: "I'll finally get to meet Lonie's parents."
[Lunar]: "Maybe I'll ask her parents for permission to marry-"
[Lonie]: "Did you say something?"
[Lunar]: "Nothing."
[Lonie]: "But I heard you say something. Please tell me..."
[Lunar]: "It's a secret."
